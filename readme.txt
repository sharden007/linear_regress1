Linear Regression provides actionable insights into spending patterns.

This Python script performs a Linear Regression analysis on sales data to predict a target variable, which in this case is the Average Purchase ($). The workflow involves loading data from a JSON file, preparing it for regression, training a model, evaluating its performance, saving predictions, and visualizing the results.


Note: This script is versatile and can be tailored to fit various predictive analytics scenarios in retail and beyond!

Use Cases
This script can be adapted for various use cases involving predictive modeling and sales analysis:

1. Retail Sales Prediction:
Predict customer spending based on demographic information (e.g., age) and purchasing habits (e.g., frequency of visits or product preferences).
Useful for businesses like Starbucks to personalize marketing strategies or optimize inventory management.

2. Customer Segmentation:
Analyze customer behavior by predicting their average purchase amount.
Helps businesses identify high-value customers or those likely to spend more on specific products.

3. Product Demand Forecasting:
Forecast demand for individual product categories (e.g., coffee, pastries) based on historical purchasing patterns.

4. Marketing Campaign Analysis:
Evaluate how factors like visit frequency or product preferences influence spending.
Provides insights into which products or promotions drive higher revenue.

5. Educational Purposes:
Demonstrates how to implement end-to-end machine learning workflows in Python.
Covers essential steps like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
